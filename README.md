## üìñ How to Use

To view a course, navigate to the URL `/courses/[folderID]`, replacing `[folderID]` with the ID of a public Google Drive folder.

For example, if your folder's shareable link is `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1At-ao1SUaSzaOXtMDXQYMvnjfn1`, the folder ID is `1At-ao1SUaSzaOXtMDXQYMvnjfn1`. You would access it at:
[http://localhost:3000/courses/1At-ao1SUaSzaOXtMDXQYMvGyOxvnjfn1](http://localhost:3000/courses/1At-ao1SUaSzaOXtMDXQYMvnjfn1)
